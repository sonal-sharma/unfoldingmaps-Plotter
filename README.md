## unfoldingmaps-plotter

This is a class project based on **Unfolding maps** library done during the *Object Oriented Programming in Java* course on Coursera. Unfolding maps library enables us to create interactive maps and geovisualizations. In this project, I coded various plots i.e. earthquake occurred across the globe, airport locations, life expenctancy in various places. 

#### Contents
This project contains following items:
1. **data directory**    : Contains datasets being used in the plotting 
2. **parsing directory** : Contains dataset parsing functions being used in the plotting code 
3. **src**				 : Contains source code of the plots (My work)

The src contains following plots:
1. Earthquake occurred across the globe
2. Airport locations
3. Life expenctancy in various places

#### How plotting help?
Plotting data on map makes it easy to understand the patterns, distributions and many more macro details which are generally lost when observing datum indivisually. For example, an earthquake dataset can be used by even a normal person while planning to build his house. Let alone govt. and big companies, who always use such kind of data and analysis.
